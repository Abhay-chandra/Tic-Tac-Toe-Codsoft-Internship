# Tic-Tac-Toe-Codsoft-Internship

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to create a row, column, or diagonal of your symbol (either "X" or "O"). The first player to achieve this wins! If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
